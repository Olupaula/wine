# Wine
Wine is great drink for many people. it remains true that our world cannot be demand for it. It therefore makes good sense if wine can be categorized into a number of classes.

## Data Source
UCL Machine Learning Repository

## Data Features and Target
The dataset had 13 features and a target. The features are:
1. Alcohol
2. Malic acid
3.Ash
4. Alcalinity of ash
5. Magnesium
6. Total phenols
7. Flavanoids
8. Nonflavanoid phenols
9. Proanthocyanins
10. Color intensity
11. Hue
12. OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
13. Proline

The target is: class

## Methods
This work uses unsupervised learning techniques, viz., K-Means, Busecting K-Means and Mini-Batch K-Means to cluster wines with 13 features. Each feature has its label, however the interest in this work is to compare the three unsupervised learning methods stated above. 

## Model Performance Evaluation
1. Inertial: here, the best model is the one with lowest inertia or sum of square error.
2. Accuracy Score: using the pre-existing labels, the accuracy of clustering of the three methods. The higher the accuracy, the better the model.

## Best Model
of the three models were compared and the K-Means had the best performance, since its inertia was the lowest and the highest accuracy score.
