# Wine
Wine is great drink for many people. it remains true that our world cannot be demand for it. It therefore makes good sense if wine can be categorized into a number of classes.
## Data Source
UCL Machine Learning Repository

## Data Features and Target
The dataset had 13 features and a target. The features are:

## Methods
This work uses unsupervised learning techniques, viz., K-Means, Busecting K-Means and Mini-Batch K-Means to cluster wines with 13 features. Each feature has its label, however the interest in this work is to compare the three unsupervised learning methods stated above. 

## Model Performance Evaluation
1. Inertial: the inertia or sum of square error of the three models were compared and the K-Means had the best performance, since its inertia was the lowest.
2. Accuracy Score: using the pre-existing labels, the accuracy of clustering of the three methods were evaluated and the K-Means method turned out to be the best again.
